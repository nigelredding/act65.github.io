During my life, I\'ve learned quite a bit about computer science merely
from having a basic background in pure mathematics. In this post, I\'ll try
to give fairly consise but rigorous overview of what I know of the area. This post
won\'t help anyone learn these topics for the first time, but they may be of value
to people wanting a refresher.

# Basics of Computation and Languages

For a set \\( S \\), we define its _Kleene Star_ to be the set \\( S^\ast \\) of all strings in  \\( S \\). This includes
the empty string \\( \varepsilon \\). For an alphabet \\( \Sigma \\) we define a _language_ \\( L \\) to be a subset of
\\( \Sigma^\ast \\). The goal is to find an effective procedure which decides if a given string \\( s \in \Sigma^\ast \\)
is also in our language. 



## Compilers

# Incompleteness and the halting problem

# Curry-Howard Correspondence

# Category Theory
