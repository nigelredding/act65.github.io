title: Conserved complexity

Given a measure of complexity, $\mathcal C$, I want it to satisfy:

<side>But the lower bound is defined according to $\mathcal C$, this seems like a trivial definition?!</side>
__Property 1__: the complexity all algorithms within the lower bound  are equivalent.

Given a problem (such a 3-SAT), one can imagine many different algorithms that may give a solution. Some might be fast, some might be accurate, some might use a lot of memory...

Each of these algorithms must lie on or behind some lower-bound of complexity.

<!-- That is the lower bound on the complexity of a problem is a(n ordered) set of algorithms that ??? -->

Let $S$ be the set of all solutions in the lower-bound, $$S = \{s : \mathcal C(s) = \mathop{min}_S \mathcal C(s)\}$$

The main intuition behind this equivalence set is that you can trade memory for time, or parallelism for energy, or ... but underneath there is still the same fundamental problem you need to solve.

* _Can this equivalence set be generalised to approximate algorithms, trading data efficiency for accuracy?_

<side>Via some sort of duality?</side>
__Property 2__: The measure of complexity for a problem and its solution is the same.

$s \in S, p \in P, \mathcal C(s) = \mathcal C(p)$.

The intuition is that the problem itself is where the complexity comes from, and is independent of the solution.

* _Is it possible to calculate C(p) without considering any solutions?_

__Property 3__: This measure of complexity is proportional to the entropy produced by the implemented algorithm.

<side>Is that structure already captured by entropy?</side>
The intuition is that algorithms require energy to be run, and this costs us information. More 'complex' problems will require more information to be destroyed than others.

Entropy is (/can be viewed as) a measure of the distribution of energy. This measure of complexity should also capture the structure (symmetries, ???) within that energy.

* _Could this could give us a lower bound on the information that must be consumed to solve our problem?_
* _What about the information required to find/construct an element of $P$ or $S$?_
