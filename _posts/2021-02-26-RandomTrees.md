## Very simple perspective on quicksort

Let a1, ..., an be a sequence of integers. Note that the ordering of these numbers induces an obvious
binary tree. We get a bijection Z^n/~ ~= Binary trees with n nodes.

We also have a map 
Let's talk about quicksort. How long does the 

Quicksort takes in tuples from the left-hand side,
