title: Random binary trees and histograms

NB: This is a work in progress.

A sequence of random variables $X_{0},X_{1},\ldots$ taking values in a set of *states* $\\{0,1,\ldots,n\\}$ is said to be a *Markov chain* if

$$
P(X_{n+1} = a_{n+1} | X_{n} = a_n, \ldots, X_{0}=a_0)
= P(X_{n+1} = a_{n+1} | X_{n} = a_{n})
$$

and we denote this probability by $p_{ij}$. We can replace $\\{0,1,\ldots,n\\}$ with any set of labels.

An example in lots of references is a simple model of the weather. There are two states: Rainy and Sunny.
