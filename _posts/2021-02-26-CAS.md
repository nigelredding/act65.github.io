# Simple functional computer algebra


Computer algebra systems are software packages for expressing and interpreting mathematical
formulae. Like WolframAlpha. It seems reasonable to restrict our attention to
elementary functions *E*. Of course, *E* is a huge space. 

It would be nice to get a fully functional system which could do

0. Expression and evaluation of elementary functions
1. Differential calculus in one variable, say, on elementary functions
2. Integral calculus on a reasonable subset of elementary functions

Let's see how well we can do.

Doing this for all of *E* is an incredibly daunting task, but I'll show how we can get pretty far
by doing it for incrementally larger subsets of *E*.
