title: Generate a histogram efficiently
---

Suppose you have a book (with $n$ words total, not the unique count), and you want to 
make a histogram counting the frequencies of each word. If we allow a very small 
chance of failure, we can do this using $O(n)$ bits of memory and $O(n \log n)$ running time.
