## First dealings with Haskell

I have a modest background in "pure math", so I was drawn to Haskell for its supposed relationship to
Category Theory. The obvious approaach to learning this would be to build a somewhat large program
in Haskell. But instead I'll focus on understanding the fundamentals. So: no coding for this post.

Let's start off with what makes Haskell special. Haskell is functional and strongly typed, which means
that all functions take in a speicific type and spit out a specific type. Your program won't compile
unless it adheres to this rule.

I assume the reader knows a bit of category theory. Let **Hask** denote the category of valid 
"types" in haskell. There is a sub-language of Haskell which allows one to construct types, very
similar to C++ templates. Recall, Haskell is strongly typed, so all functions have strictly 
enforced signatures. The arrows in **Hask** are Haskell programs.

One obvious question is whether this even is a category. Dissapointingly, I found that this is a 
controversial question in the mathematical community: http://math.andrej.com/2016/08/06/hask-is-not-a-category/. However, this is not entirely surprising. I have heard many times how C++ templates are
"like" Functors, but I feel like this is BS. I imagine the watery thinking around Haskell is similar.

Let's address the controversy.
