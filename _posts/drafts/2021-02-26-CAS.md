# Simple functional computer algebra


Computer algebra systems are software packages for expressing and interpreting mathematical
formulae. Like WolframAlpha. It seems reasonable to restrict our attention to
elementary functions *E*. Of course, *E* is a huge space. 

It would be nice to get a fully functional system which could do

0. Expression and evaluation of elementary functions
1. Differential calculus in one variable, say, on elementary functions
2. Integral calculus on a reasonable subset of elementary functions

Let's see how well we can do.

Doing this for all of *E* is an incredibly daunting task, but I'll show how we can get pretty far
by doing it for incrementally larger subsets of *E*.

## First stab

Let's start by restricting our attention to polynomials with real-valued coefficients. Formally, we're
concerned with the space

$$ E := span \{ x^k, \sin^k(x), \cos^k(x), \tan^k(x) : k \geq 0 \} $$

We can see *E* in at least a couple of different ways, which will influence how we program our system.
One approach is to see elements of *E* as linear combinations of $$ latex x^k, \sin^k(x), \cos^k(x), \tan^k(x). $$
Then, 
And let's look at it in the Scheme programming language. 

Monomials
Trig terms
Functions : 

We define a monomial to be a cons-cell. So
$$ latex 10x^3 $$ will be represented as *10 cons 3*. A monomial is a list of cons cells.
