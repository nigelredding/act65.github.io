title: Randomized algorithm for the 2-SAT problem
---

## The problem
Let $\phi$ be a boolean formula in $2$-CNF form (i.e.
conjunctive normal form, where each clause has $2$ literals).
We give a randomized algorithm which solves this problem. We
follow [ยง7.1.1, Mitzenmacher & Upfal](https://www.amazon.ca/Probability-Computing-Randomized-Algorithms-Probabilistic/dp/0521835402).

The description of how the algorithm works is easy. What is interesting
is the probabilistic analysis of it.

```python
def rand2Sat($\phi$, initSolution):
	...
```
 
# We say a boolean expression is in *conjunctive normal form*
#if it is a conjuction of clauses, where each clause is a disjuction
# of literals.
