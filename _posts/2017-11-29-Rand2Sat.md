title: Randomized algorithm for the 2-SAT problem
---

## The problem
Let $\phi$ be a boolean formula in $2$-CNF form (i.e.
conjunctive normal form, where each clause has $2$ literals).

# We say a boolean expression is in *conjunctive normal form*
#if it is a conjuction of clauses, where each clause is a disjuction
# of literals.
