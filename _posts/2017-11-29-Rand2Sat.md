title: Randomized algorithm for the 2-SAT problem
---

NB: This is a work in progress.

## The problem
Let $\phi$ be a boolean formula in $2$-CNF form (i.e.
conjunctive normal form, where each clause has $2$ literals).
Suppose it has $n$ variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. The problem
is to find an assignment of the variables which makes $\phi$ true.

We give a randomized algorithm which solves this problem. We
follow [ยง7.1.1, Mitzenmacher & Upfal](https://www.amazon.ca/Probability-Computing-Randomized-Algorithms-Probabilistic/dp/0521835402).

The description of how the algorithm works is easy. What is interesting
is the probabilistic analysis of it.

```python
def rand2Sat(phi, initSolution, numIters):
	...
```
