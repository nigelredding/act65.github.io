      <title>Introduction to Elliptic curves</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is the first post in a two part series on Elliptic Curves. In this post,
I&#39;ll lay out the background on the subject. We won&#39;t discuss any applications, but merely
give the reader a basic idea of how much structure there is in this subject: from algebra,
to geometry, to number theory and even analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader may already be familiar with the definition of an elliptic curve as a
curve defined by the equation $$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$ for coefficients in some field
\( F \), and where the discriminant \( \Delta = 4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0 \). This is a very myterious definition.
Some obvious questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q1. Why are we concerened with degree 3 curves, let alone degree 3 curves of this particular form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q2. What is the significance of \( \Delta \) being nonzero?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q3. Is there a more general theory in the background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this post, I hope to have at least partially answered these questions. This is a large area of mathematics,
and one I know relatively little about, but I hope to give the reader the intuition that there is
an incredibly rich interplay between algebra, geometry and number theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;linear-case&#34;&gt;Linear case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s start by discussing the linear case in two variables, i.e. the problem of finding integral solutions
to equations of the form $$ ax + by = c $$ for fixed integers \( a,b,c  \).
Denote \( d := \gcd(a,b) \). If \( d \) does not divide \( c \), then there is no integral solution. So assume
\( d \) does indeed divide \( c \).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of looking at this is to consider the ring homomorphism \( \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \)
given by mapping each integer to its remainder when divided by \( n \). [EXPAND]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quadratic-forms-homogeneous-quadratic-case&#34;&gt;Quadratic forms (homogeneous quadratic case)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced from the linear case is the quadratic case in two variables. A &lt;em&gt;quadratic form&lt;/em&gt; is a polynomial
of the form $$ ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 $$ where \( a,b,c \). One of the fundamental problems in the theory of
Quadratic forms is to find the set of integers represented by a given quadratic form. I admit this is a subject
I know very little about. I am planning on making time to go over &lt;a href=&#34;https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/Courses/Chapter4.pdf&#34;&gt;https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/Courses/Chapter4.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.
[Another post?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elliptic-curves-non-degenerate-cubic-case&#34;&gt;Elliptic Curves (non-degenerate cubic case)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most general setting (without getting totally crazy) is the setting of &lt;em&gt;algebraic varieties&lt;/em&gt;, which are
solution sets to simultaneous polynomials. But from just looking at examples of elliptic curves, and
the structure that falls out, we see that we already have plenty on our plate to understand without
getting too abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s answer Q2 above: What is the meaning of \( \Delta \neq 0 \) in our definition?
The &lt;em&gt;discriminant&lt;/em&gt; for a polynomial \( p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \)
with roots \( r_0, \cdots, r_{n-1} \) is defined as $$ \Delta := a_n^{2n-2} \prod\limits_{i \neq j} (r_i - r_j) $$
The reader can verify that for a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the discriminant is indeed
\( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \). When \( \Delta = 0 \), we have a multiple root. Why do we care if our
curve has a multiple root? We need to learn a bit of algebraic geometry to answer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-little-bit-of-algebraic-geometry&#34;&gt;A little bit of algebraic geometry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a curve  \( C/F \) defined by \( f \in F[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \). A singularity is a point
\( P \in F^n \) such that \( f&amp;rsquo;(P) = 0 \). We say \( C \) is smooth if it has no singularities.
It&#39;s not hard to see that \( C \) is smooth &lt;em&gt;iff&lt;/em&gt; \( \Delta \neq 0 \).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[EXAMPLES AND TYPES OF SINGULARITIES]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will abuse notation a bit and think of \( F[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \) as a ring of
functions \( F^n \to F \), not just polynomial expressions in \( F \). Define
\( F[C] \) to be the ring of functions in \( F[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \) restricted to \( C \).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very nitpicky point about our choice of notation. If we wanted to be really formal, we could say
that we are working in &amp;ldquo;Affine Space&amp;rdquo; \( \mathbb{A}^n \), which is basically just \( F^n \),
but with some extra mathematical structure. I&#39;ll avoid this formalism and try to keep it down to
earth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whirlwind Computer Science Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my life, I&#39;ve learned quite a bit about computer science merely
from having a basic background in pure mathematics. In this post, I&#39;ll try
to give fairly consise but rigorous overview of what I know of the area. This post
won&#39;t help anyone learn these topics for the first time, but they may be of value
to people wanting a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;basics-of-computation-and-languages&#34;&gt;Basics of Computation and Languages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a set \( S \), we define its &lt;em&gt;Kleene Star&lt;/em&gt; to be the set \( S^\ast \) of all strings in  \( S \). This includes
the empty string \( \varepsilon \). For an alphabet \( \Sigma \) we define a &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; \( L \) to be a subset of
\( \Sigma^\ast \). The goal is to find an effective procedure which decides if a given string \( s \in \Sigma^\ast \)
is also in our language.&lt;/p&gt;
